# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

<button></button> = is how we create a submit button. This would submit the form
<button type="reset"></button> = resets each part of the form to its default values
<button type="button"></button> = initiates the JS that is connected to the form?
<button type="submit"></button> = submite/finalizes the form

Your answer identifies the types of buttons but needs clarification on the default behaviors, particularly for buttons without a type and type="button", and should emphasize that a submit button submits the form data to the server.
