# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

<button></button>: This button acts as a submit button by default, submitting the form when clicked.
<button type="reset"></button>: Resets each part of the form to its default values.
<button type="button"></button>: This button doesn't have a default behavior, generally it runs/initiates all of the JavaScript connected to the form.
<button type="submit"></button>: Submits the form data to the server.

Your answer identifies the types of buttons but needs clarification on the default behaviors, particularly for buttons without a type and type="button", and should emphasize that a submit button submits the form data to the server.
