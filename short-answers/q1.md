# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?
# Answer
This has happened because form data is being appeneded to the url due to the form using the given GET method via submission. To stop this from happening we need to add a event listener and call the event.preventdefault in JS
